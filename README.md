# foody-application
This is my playground project where I integrate new things which I've been learning in order to get better experience. The project constists of backend written on Django and a native android application.
The project itself is food ordery service. I fency Glovo design therefore I use almost the same design, colors.

# Overview
The android application consists of three modes. One mode is for clients where they can order food. Second mode is for cooks where they can accept and handle orders. And the last mode
is for administrative purposes where is implemented adding, removing and editing products.

### 1.1 Authentication & Authorization view
Authentication is done by Token-based protocol.

In order to get access to the application user must sign up and then confirm an email. If the user checked "I want to cook", it is also needed to be accepter by the administrator.

When the user is cook or administrator, then there is a view to select a specific role.

# foody-application
This is my playground project where I integrate new things which I've been learning in order to get better experience. The project constists of backend written on Django and a native android application.
The project itself is food ordery service. I fency Glovo design therefore I use almost the same design, colors.

# Overview
The android application consists of three modes. One mode is for clients where they can order food. Second mode is for cooks where they can accept and handle orders. And the last mode
is for administrative purposes where is implemented adding, removing and editing products.
